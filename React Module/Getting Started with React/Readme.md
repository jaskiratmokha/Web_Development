# Why React ?

React helps in creating user interfaces by providing a declarative and efficient way to build UI components. React allows developers to break down complex user interfaces into small, reusable components that can be composed together to create the final UI.

# React is all about Components

React is all about components. A component in React is a small, reusable piece of code that encapsulates a specific functionality or UI element. Components are the building blocks of a React application, and they can be composed together to create complex user interfaces.

React follows a component-based architecture, which means that the application is structured as a tree of components. Each component can have its own state, which determines its behavior and how it interacts with other components. Components can also receive input in the form of props, which are passed down from parent components.

# React follows Declarative Approach

React follows a declarative approach to building user interfaces. In a declarative approach, developers specify what they want the UI to look like, and the library or framework takes care of the details of how to render it.

In React, developers define UI components using a declarative syntax that describes what the component should render based on its current props and state. Whenever the state of a component changes, React updates the UI to reflect the new state in a predictable and efficient way.

By following a declarative approach, React makes it easier for developers to reason about their code and build more maintainable applications. Instead of having to manually manipulate the DOM to update the UI, developers can focus on describing the desired UI state and let React handle the implementation details.

# How to create a React App using create-react-app

To create a new React app using create-react-app, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React app.
3. Run the following command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace my-app with the name you want to give to your app. This will create a new directory named my-app in your current directory.

4. Once the installation is complete, navigate into the newly created directory by running the following command:

```
cd my-app
```

5. Start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your app in the browser. You can now start building your React app.

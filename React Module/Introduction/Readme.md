# What is React and why we need to learn about it ?

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

## React at a glance:

1. React is a client-side Javascript Library.
2. React helps us to build modern Reactive User Interfaces for the web.
3. React is based on declarative/component based approach.

# Building Single Page applications (SPAs) using ReactJS

Unlike traditional websites made using plain HTML,CSS and Javascript which results in opening up a new HTML page everytime we click on a link/url, when using react only one HTML Page is rendered and all the changed are made using the Javascript DOM manipulation.

# React Alternatives (Angular/Vue)

Angluar and Vue are the 2 most popular Javascript Frameworks in the market and the thing which makes them different from React is that additional features like "routing" are included with these frameworks and we dont need to isntall them via packages like we have to do when working with React.
